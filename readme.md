# Introduction: Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

todo

# Setup

Create a virtual environment
- python3 -m virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate

Install Python dependancies:

- python3 -m pip install torch

- python3 -m pip install numpy
- python3 -m pip install pygame

- python3 -m pip install matplotlib

note: under Ubuntu 22.02, for some reasons, you have to install these packages in order to visualize with matplotlib

- python3 -m pip install PyQt5 

- python3 -m pip install "cython<3" 

Execute the application (PPO):
- python3 06-


# Notes

- Danger of numeric instability if the rewards barely change (devision by 0).
